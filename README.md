👋 Hey there, I'm <b>@GiovanniMenon</b>, currently studying Computer Science at the University of Padua.

🚀 Currently, I'm working on a project using Next.js and LangchainJS to practice and improve my skills in the JavaScript domain.

🔒 Additionally, I'm diving into network security as part of a university research project, exploring its nuances and methodologies in a hands-on manner.

🌐 You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giovanni-menon/).
